   <h6 class="h6" style="font-size:20px;"> The Dort Motor Car Company of Flint, Michigan, built automobiles from 1915-1924. Dort used Lycoming-built engines to power
    their vehicles. <br>Dort Motor Car Company grew from Durant-Dort Carriage Company founded by William C Durant and J Dallas
    Dort. <br>They remained business partners until about 1915.<br> Dort took over the carriage business and in 1915 began to use
    the same plant to manufacture his Dort cars. Carriage production ended in 1917. <br>Dort shipped 9,000 cars in its first
    year.By 1917, Dort was offering four models: a closed sedan at $1,065, a convertible sedan at $815, a<br> five-place open
    tourer at $695, and a Fleur-de-Lys roadster at $695. <br>By contrast, Ford Model Ts were selling for $440 in 1915.By 1920
    Dort was the country's 13th largest automobile producer but in 1924 Dort decided to<br> retire and he liquidated Dort Motor
    Car Company. He sold the factory building to AC Spark Plug.<br> J Dallas Dort died the following year.</h6>
