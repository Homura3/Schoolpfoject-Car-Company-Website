            New BMW X4 revealed (with M40i and M40d models)!
            BMW has revealed its new X4, seen here in M40d guise.
            Published by Ryan Bubear on February 14, 201
            BMW has taken the wraps off its new, second-generation X4, with the coupé-style SUV growing appreciably in size and the line-up gaining a pair of “M Performance” models.
            Based on the latest G01-generation X3, the new X4 is 81 mm longer and 37 mm wider than the model it replaces, while its wheelbase has been stretched a further 54 mm to 2 864 mm. Load space can be expanded from a claimed 525 litres to a maximum of 1 430 litres by folding down sections of the rear backrest (which is split 40:20:40).
            The new X4 is scheduled to arrive in South Africa in the third quarter of 2018. Customers will have the choice of xLine, M Sport X and M Sport variants.
            BMW says buyers will be able to choose from three petrol and four diesel engines, although South Africa will miss out on one engine option, with the local range set to initially comprise the xDrive20i, xDrive20d, xDrive30i and M40i. The xDrive30d is due to arrive in the final quarter of 2018, with the M40d joining the range in the first quarter of 2019</p>
